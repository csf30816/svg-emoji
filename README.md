# SVG Emoji
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.2-yellow.svg)

SVG Emoji is a emoji library I am working on. You can add SVG Emoji to your website by adding ```<script src="https://csf30816.github.io/svg-emoji/src/emoji.js"></script>``` to your HTML `<head>` tag. For any other support or questions please create an issue.

You can find a full list of emoji's here: https://csf30816.github.io/svg-emoji/list.html but to find a list of 'emoji codes' to make them appear you must look in the wiki.

## Credit
I have been asked about if you need to add credit towards me. The answer is no. I do not need credit.
